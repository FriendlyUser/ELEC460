I'll try to take latex notes for the elec 460 class, perhaps I'll work on them before the lecture begins and make notes on what I can improve later, that is I'll probably get to school at 7:46 AM, or be late lol (8.19 AM Unreliable)

Going off the previously version on the notes and either take screenshots or notes manually, I'll try my best to make a pandoc compliant format, but that would involve creating images seperately, which is more suitable for an assignment, or if they are done in matlab, inkscape.

Creating a html file from a pdf latex document.
```shell
copy ELEC460Notes.pdf "C:\Users\wu\Downloads\University Fun\School\Fall 2017\Other\pdf2htmlEX-win32-0.14.6-with-poppler-data\ELEC460Notes.pdf"
cd C:\Users\wu\Downloads\University Fun\School\Fall 2017\Other\pdf2htmlEX-win32-0.14.6-with-poppler-data
pdf2htmlEX ELEC460Notes.pdf
``` 

To run the make file, just drag the file into bash or consider using make in git bash.
